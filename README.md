# Earphone-Gesture-Interaction

Headphones are becoming an increasingly important interactive device in people's daily lives. But the way of interacting with headphones is still very scarce. In this project, we propose a method of interacting with headphones through facial gestures, and try to identify and classify gestures through acoustic features. The main methods we use include: user research, real-time audio processing, deep neural networks, etc.
